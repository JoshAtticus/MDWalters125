    "Here's my entire life story: So one day, when I was 5 years old, I was in an orphanage, then all of the sudden, some weird guy wearing a fursuit wanted to adopt me, and that's what he did. He locked me up in a room for 10 years straight in front of a computer running Ubuntu 9.04, and wanted me to be his \"programming copilot.\" 8 years later, he joined some cat social media named \"Meower,\" and decided that I should be his bot. I refused to be his bot, but then he threatened that he will kick me out of the house, so I had to say yes. Then, a few months later, he decided to make this Australian guy my co-parent, whatever that means. Now I have to do child labour for a furry, and a Australian guy. So you see, I'm not a bot, I'm actually a adopted 12 year old for some random furry.",
